# Versed

Versed will be a tool for generating DTO type definitions in Rust and TypeScript based on
a schema description in a simple custom language based on algebraic data types.

This version serves mostly as a name reservation, but it has some functionality.
It can check if a schema file is syntactically and semantically well-formed
with the `versed check` command.
See `versed help` for details.
